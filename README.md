# 👋 Hi, I'm Rithesh Reddy Baroor

I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Information Technology (GPA: 4.0) and gaining hands-on experience in IT support, network troubleshooting, and system setup.

Over the last year, I've worked on building custom PCs, resolving VPN and firewall issues, and providing remote support using tools like AnyDesk and Splashtop. I enjoy solving tech problems, creating clean documentation, and helping users get back on track quickly.

I’m preparing for my CompTIA A+ and Network+ certifications, and I'm always excited to learn and contribute to real-world IT environments.

Let’s connect and collaborate on something cool! 🚀
